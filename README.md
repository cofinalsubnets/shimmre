# shimmre

_Shucks Howdy! It's a Mini Metagrammar Reification Engine_

Shimmre is a PEG-based parser/compiler generator inspired by OMeta. The baseline
implementation lives in a couple hundred lines of CoffeeScript (there's also a
mostly complete self-hosted version that's quite a bit smaller). Shimmre is
specifically designed to be portable to new host languages with minimal effort.
